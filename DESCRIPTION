Description: This package is used for Bayesian analysis of high-throughput genomic assays, such as MPRA and CRISPR screens. The output counts, whether MPRA barcodes or CRISPR gRNAs, are modelled as coming from a negative binomial distribution with empirical gamma priors. The empirical priors can be refined through the use of user-input annotations, further improving model performance.
